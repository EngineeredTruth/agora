                <h3>GET PRE-APPROVED</h3>
                <p>
                    When considering an offer, the seller will want to know how you plan on financing your purchase. Most buyers in Hawaii will obtain a loan in order to assist them with buying a home. By getting a pre-approval letter from your lender, it will instill confidence
                    with the seller by reassuring them that you already qualify for a loan and are ready to buy.

                <h3>KNOW WHAT YOU WANT</h3>
                <p>
                    Purchasing a home can be challenging. Whether your buying something for you and your family or your an investor, there are a lot of different variables to consider which will ultimately impact your decision. This is where I come in. As your real estate
                    agent, I will help find a property on Oahu that is right for you. One of the first steps is to go over your wants and needs. This will help us both determine what criteria we need to look for when screening potential homes for you.

                <h3>BE PREPARED</h3>
                <p>
                    Your Hawaii dream home is waiting for you; we just need to find it. The real estate market changes on a daily basis. With homes coming and going, real estate on Oahu moves very quickly. To give us an advantage, I will update you regularly with homes that
                    meet your criteria. When you find something that you like, we will need to work together to view the home and determine if it's right for you and your family. This could take anywhere from a few days to a couple weeks depending on
                    what is currently available on the market. It's important to be ready to submit an offer right away once you find a home that you like. This will give us an edge as the sooner I can get an offer to the seller's agent, the more likely
                    we are to get it approved.
